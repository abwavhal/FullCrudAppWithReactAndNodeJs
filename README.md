Project Setup Instructions

1)First, clone the repository using the following command:
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate into the cloned project directory.

2)Pull the latest changes from the main branch:
git pull origin main

3)Check the current status of your working directory:
git status

4)Inside the project directory, you will find two folders: frontend and backend.
Open two separate terminal windows or Command Prompt instances:
In the first terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and run:
npm run dev
In the second terminal, navigate to the backend folder and run:
npm start


Once both servers are running, open the project in your browser to view it locally.
